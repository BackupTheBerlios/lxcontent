	<h2 id="download">1. Download</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			First of all you need to download the latest release from the
			<a href="https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3548">download page</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can extract the archive. If your downloaded the *.tar.gz file type
			<pre>tar xzvf lxcontent-xxx.tar.gz</pre>
			for the *.tar.bz2 write
			<pre>tar xjvf lxcontent-xxx.tar.bz2</pre>
			Of course you have to use the correct file name ;-)
		</li>
		<li>
			Change to the new directory
			<pre>cd lxcontent</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can configurate the script and upload it to your webspace/server.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="configuration">2.  Configuration</h2>
	<p>
		You can configurate lX Content in the file <code>config.php</code> in the
		<code>conf</code>-directory. Following options are available and <em>must</em>
		be declarated.
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><code>$config['template']</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Specifies a subdirectory of <code>templates</code>. Default
				is <q><code>default</code></q>. If you want to modify the template
				or write a own one, have a look at the
				<a href="#templates">templates section</a>.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>$config['title']</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Should contain the title of the website (<em>not</em> the headline
				or something). The real title of the website is made up from the
				title given from this option and the title of the content site
				which is currently displayed.<br />
				e.g.: <code>$config['title']</code> is <q>foobar</q> and the
				title of the content site is <q>don't know what to write</q>
				the title really used is <q>foobar - don't know what to write</q>.
				<br />
				<strong>Note</strong>: The title is not the headline of the website, this
				should be given in the templatefile. The title is the string
				which is usually  displayed as window title of the browser.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>$config['keywords']</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The keywords are used by search-bots (like
				<a href="http://www.google.de/">Google</a>). The keywords which are
				really used are made up from the keywords in the options and from
				the keywords the content filei is containing.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>$config['describtion']</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Contains a describtion of the website. This option is only used,
				if the content file doesn't contain a own describtion. (see
				<a href="#contentfiles">content files section</a>)
			</dd>
		<dt><code>$config['start_page']</code></dt>
			<dd>
				This option should contain a valid file, which is used as start page.
				The filename has to contain the section directory but must not contain
				<q><code>content/</code></q>. For example your start page should be
				<code>content/home/start.html</code>. In this case the category directory
				is <code>home</code>, and you have to give
				<q><code>home/start.html</code></q> to this option.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>$config['stylesheet']</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The filename of the stylesheet you want to use. The given filename
				has to be relative to the installation directory of lX Content.
				For example lX Content is stored in <code>/lxcontent</code> and your
				stylesheet is stored in <code>/lxcontent/templates/foobar/style.css</code>
				you should give <q><code>templates/foobar/style.css</code></q> to
				this option.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>$config['default_script']</code></dt>
			<dd>
				This option isn not used so far, but it <em>must</em> be set to anything,
				otherwise you get errors.
			</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>
		To set an option, write the option followed by an equal sign and a string between
		apostrophe. At the end of a line must be a semicolon. For example:
	</p>
	<pre>$config['start_page'] = "main/start.html";</pre>
	<h2 id="categories">3. Categories</h2>
	<p>
		You have to set up at least one category to make the script working correctly.
		This is very easy. You only have to create a subdirectory inside the
		<code>content</code>-directory. For example <q><code>foobar</code></q>.
		Now the directory <code>content/foobar</code> can contain data for
		the categorie named <q>foobar</q>. The directory name should only contain
		lowercase letters and no spaces or special characters. The name of the directory
		is used as the category name, but you can change this by creating a
		<a href="#directory.xml">directory.xml</a>-file inside the category-directory.
	</p>
	<h2 id="directory.xml">4. directory.xml</h2>
	<p>
		With this file you can modify the name of the category it belongs to, you
		can create a menu for the category, give an alternative stylesheet to use
		for this category, and specify a category start page.
		You don't need to create such a file, but it make really make sense, because
		if you don't the category name is the same as the name of the category directory,
		what doesn't looks very nice ;-)
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>directory.xml</code> is XML-file, and need to be valid.
		The root element is <code>directory</code>. An example for the
		<code>directory.xml</code> can be found at
		<a href="directory.xml_example"><q>directory.xml - example</q></a>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="directory.xml_title">The category name</h3>
	<p>
		You really should take advantage of the possibility to set a name for 
		a category. If you don't do so, the name of the category-directory would
		be used.
		To set a name simply add a <code>category_name</code>-tag inside the
		root element of the <code>directory.xml</code> file.
		For example:
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;category_name&gt;any category name&lt;/category_name&gt;</pre>
	<h3 id="directory.xml_menu">A not automatically generated category menu</h3>
	<p>
		Usually the category menu is generated automatically from the files
		stored in the category directory, but sometimes you need to
		change something in the menu (if you want to add a searchbox in the menu,
		or if you don't want all files from the directory to be listed in menu
		for example), if you want to do this, the <code>menu</code>-tag
		gives you this possibility. To add items to the menu you have to
		add <code>item</code>-tags into <code>menu</code>. Than you have
		two possibilities. A <code>item</code>-tag can either contain a
		<code>file</code>-tag or a <code>raw_data</code>-tag. If you use the
		<code>file_tag</code> you can specify a file (of this category and
		without path!) to link to. The link title is generated from the title
		of the file. If you use the <code>raw_data</code>-tag you can insert
		any xhtml-code into it. This code will be added to the menu how it is.
	</p>
	<h3 id="directory.xml_stylesheet">Use a non-standard stylesheet for the category</h3>
	<p>
		You can use for each category a own style sheet. You can specify it with the
		<code>stylesheet</code>-tag. The specified filename has to be a filename
		with path relative to the lX Content directory.
		If you don't use this option, the stylesheet from <code>config.php</code>
		or from the template will be used.
	</p>
	<h3 id="directory.xml_mainpage">Specify a home page for the category</h3>
	<p>
		Specify a home page for the category with the <code>main_page</code>-tag.
		The filename must be without path and it has to be a file stored in
		the category-directory. This file will be used as content file, when
		the category is chosen from the main menu.
		You should specify a file. If you don't it could be any file which is used as
		home page for the category.
	</p>
	<h3 id="directory.xml_example">directory.xml - example</h3>
	<p>
		This is a example for a <code>directory.xml</code> file. You don't need to
		set any of the <code>/directory/*</code> elements. If you don't set something
		it would be generated automatically. So you only need to set options wich
		should not be like the defaults.
	</p>
	<pre>&lt;directory&gt;
	&lt;category_name&gt;Test Category&lt;/category_name&gt;

	&lt;menu&gt;
		&lt;item&gt;
			&lt;file&gt;foobar.html&lt;/file&gt;
		&lt;/item&gt;
		&lt;item&gt;
			&lt;raw_data&gt;&lt;a href="http://example.com"&gt;example.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/raw_data&gt;
		&lt;/item&gt;
	&lt;/menu&gt;
	&lt;stylesheet&gt;anystylesheet.css&lt;/stylesheet&gt;

	&lt;main_page&gt;start.html&lt;/main_page&gt;
&lt;/directory&gt;</pre>
	<h2 id="contentfiles">5. Content files</h2>
	<p>
		Until now you have categories, perhaps menus, but no content.
		To add content is very easy. There are two primary possibilities.
		You can use <strong>valid XHTML</strong> Documents, or XML
		Documents.
	</p>
	<h3 id="contentfiles_html">Using XHTML files</h3>
	<p>
		To use an XHTML-file as content, simply store it in the directory of the
		category it should belong to. Don't forget to give it the extension <q>.html</q>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If XHTML files will be used by lX Content. Only
		the title has to be present (also to be valid XHTML).
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the content of the <code>title</code>-tag is added to the site title given in <code>config.php</code></li>
		<li>a site describtion given by <code>meta</code>-tag (<code>&lt;meta name="DESCRIBTION" content="a very nice site" /&gt;</code>; name-value has to be upper-case)</li>
		<li>the keywords (<code>&lt;meta name="KEYWORDS" content="foo, bar, bla" /&gt;</code>; name-value has to be upper-case) of the content site are added to the keywords specified in <code>config.php</code></li>
		<li>the content ;-) (everything between <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="contentfiles_xml">Using XML</h3>
	<p>
		The other way to insert content is by using XML-files.
		The root element of the file has to be <code>content</code>.
		Than it <em>need</em> to has a <code>script</code>-Element
		as child of <code>content</code>-element. This element
		has to contain the name of the script which would
		generate content from the file. "the name of the script" is 
		the filename <strong>without</strong> it's extension (<q>.php</q>).
		The <code>content</code>-element also should contain a
		<code>title</code>-element. This is used the same way as 
		by using XHTML-files.
	</p>
	<p>
		The scripts to generate the content from an XML-file (or an other source, thats
		also possible, but they are only called when they are specified in an
		XML file) can be written very easily, if you have some experience in
		coding PHP. You have to store a file with the extension <q>.php</q> in the
		<code>scripts</code>-direcory of lX Content. The filename <em>without</em>
		the extension is the script-name which is given in the XML file.
		Inside your script you have to specify a function named <code>generateOutput</code>
		and which takes one argument.
	</p>
	<pre>function generateOutput($xmlParser) {
	/* you code */
	return $html; // function has to return valid xhtml-code
}</pre>
	<p>
		The argument <var>$xmlParser</var> will be a <code>XPath</code> object 
		(see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpxpath/">Sourceforge - Php.XPath</a> for
		more information about this object) with loaded content.
		The function has to return <strong>valid xhtml</strong>!
		The string returned by this function is stored at the content-position
		in the main template.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Tip</strong>: You can use the <code>template</code>-function for
		generating output with an easy to change layout.
		The <code>template</code>-function is declarated as follow:
	</p>
	<pre>function template($vars, $templatefile)</pre>
	<p>
		<var>$templatefile</var> is a filename (relative to lX Content directory)
		which contains the template.
		<var>$vars</var> is a array of elements which can be used in the templatefile.
		If a name of an element between percent symbols (<q>%</q>) exists in the
		templatefile it will be restored with the value of the element.
		The function returns a string with the restored content of the templatefile.
	</p>
	<h2 id="templates">6. Templates</h2>
	<p>
		Now you have all content for your lX Content-website.
		You only need a nice, individual design.
		Making a template for lX Content is very easy, because it's only one file
		(until now ;-)). Simply make a design or take a website and delete it's
		content. But there is one thing you <strong>must not</strong> forget.
		The templatefile will be stored in a subdirectory of the
		<code>template</code>-directory. But when the templatefile is
		used by lX Content it will be included in the <code>index.php</code>-file
		in the lX Content root directory.
		So all links and image paths, etc. have to be relative to the lX Content
		root directory (where the <code>index.php</code> file is stored).
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have made a design (without content) you can place some placeholder
		in it, to say lX Content where to include the content.
		Following placeholder are available:
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><code>describtion</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The site describtion. Should be placed in the <code>meta</code>-tag for the describtion.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>keywords</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The site keywords. Should be placed in the <code>meta</code>-tag for the keywords.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>title</code></dt>
			<dd>
				This gives the title of the site. It should be placed inside the <code>title</code>-tag.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>stylesheet</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The path of the stylesheet specified by <code>config.php</code> or by the content file.
				Sometimes (mostly?) it makes more sense for a stylesheet to link it statically in
				the templatefile.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>mainmenu</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Contains the items of the main menu which links to the different categories.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>catmenu</code></dt>
			<dd>
				Contains the items of the category menu.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>category</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The name of the category.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>generation_time</code></dt>
			<dd>
				The time lX Content needed to generate the output in seconds. By me at home it's usually 0.
			</dd>
		<dt><code>some more</code></dt>
			<dd>
				There are some more placeholders you theoretically can use in the templatefile, but
				the most things doesn't make sense in a templatefile and are only used from lX Content
				itself. If you want to play around with this stuff look at <code>system/main.php</code>.
				There is a array named <var>$var</var> which element names can be used with <q>%</q>
				around it in the templatefile.
			</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>
		All placeholder has to be stored between percent symbols (<q>%</q>). For example <code>%foobar%</code>.
		(I can not use a real placeholder as example, because it possibly will be replaced ;-))
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have written your templatefile, create a subdirectory in the <code>templates</code> directory and
		store your templatefile in it as <code>main.html</code>. Now you can specify it in the
		<code>config.php</code> file.
